\opening{Dear Editor,}

Please find enclosed a manuscript on the ``Spatial and seasonal effects of temperature variability in a positive degree day surface melt model'' which I would like to submit as a correspondence to the \emph{Journal of Glaciology}.

This short manuscript deals with the issue of temperature variability in a positive degree day surface melt model. The effects of temperature variability on (modelled) surface melt have since long been recognized and included in numerical ice sheet models. However, regional and seasonal patterns of temperature variability are usually not considered, which is the point I try to address here.

This manuscript can be of interest to users and developers of numerical ice sheet models. More specifically, the formula published by Calov and Greve (\emph{Journal of Glaciology} \textbf{51}(172): 173--175, 2005) and providing a basis for my manuscript is now implemented and in use in the three open-source and widely distributed models SICOPOLIS, PISM and Elmer/Ice.

Thank you in advance for considering the present submission,

\closing{Best regards,}

\end{letter}
