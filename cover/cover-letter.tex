\opening{Dear Editor,}

Please find enclosed a manuscript on ``Daily temperature variability predetermined by thermal conditions over ice sheet surfaces'' for publication as a correspondence in the \emph{Journal of Glaciology}.

This short manuscript presents a novel parametrization of the effect of daily temperature variability on surface melt in ice sheet models. In this study, we analyse atmospheric reanalysis temperature fields over the Greenland ice sheet and reveal an inverse relationship between temperature standard deviation and long-term temperature mean. The decrease of variability with increasing temperature towards the melting point shows a natural mechanism for attenuation of its effect on melt, the neglect of which leads to a significant overestimation of the modelled ice loss through surface ablation.

This manuscript primarily targets users and developers of numerical models of long-term ice sheet evolution, which makes us believe that the correspondence format of the \emph{Journal of Glaciology} suits it best.

Thank you in advance for considering the present submission,

\closing{Best regards,}

\end{letter}
