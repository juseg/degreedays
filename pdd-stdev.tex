\section{Introduction}

The positive degree day model is a parametrization of surface melt introduced by \citet{braithwaite-1984} and widely used in glacier modelling. Surface melt is assumed to be proportional to the number of Positive Degree Day (PDD), defined as the integral of positive, daily Celcius temperatures over time.

The effect of day-to-day variations of temperature on surface melt was recognized by \citet{braithwaite-1984} and later modelled by \citet{reeh-1991}, assuming a normal probability distribution of temperature $T$ around a central value $T_{ac}$,

\begin{equation}
  p(T) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}
    \exp\left({-\frac{(T-T_{ac})^2}{2\sigma^2}}\right).
\end{equation}

More recently, \citet{calov-greve-2005} showed that, under the normal distribution assumption, the PDD integral could then be reformulated as

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{PDD} = \int_{0}^{A} dt \left[
    \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
    \exp\left({-\frac{T_{ac}(t)^2}{2\sigma^2}}\right)
    +\frac{T_{ac}(t)}{2}
    \mathrm{erfc} \left(-\frac{T_{ac}(t)}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right)
  \right],
\end{equation}

where $T_{ac}$ is the annual temperature cycle and $\sigma$ and the standard deviation of temperature, thereby providing a more computationally-efficient expression to numerical glacier models.

This approach has now been implemented and used in several numerical glacier models, and the role of temperature variability has been emphasized by \citet{charbit-etal-2012}. However the $\sigma$ parameter if generally set as a constant in time and and space, which is a limitation to the accuracy of modelled mass balances \citep{charbit-etal-2012}.

Here I show that the $\sigma$ parameter is highly variable spatially and seasonaly, which has significant effects on PDD-modelled mass-balances.Ã©

\section{Temperature variability}

Monthly standard deviations of daily temperatures were computed from the ERA-Interim\citep{data:erai} analysis (step~0) data using the following algorythm:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item daily means of surface air temperature were calculated by averaging the four daily analysis time steps (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00);
  \item daily means were stacked by month over a 22-years (1979--2012) time interval;
  \item monthly standard deviation were computed for each month.
\end{enumerate}

This approach captures not only the day-to-day but also the year-to-year variation of air surface temperature. Temperature time-series, however, were not been detrended from the annual cycle, which may have lead to slightly overestimates values in Spring and Autumn months.

\end{figure}

Computed values range from 0.32 to 12.63\,K, with a global seasonal average of 2.02\,K. January and July distributions are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stdev}. There is a tendency for higher dtandard deviation of temperature in continental regions, and in winter.
